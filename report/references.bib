  abstract = {Food is considered as a basic need of human being which can be satisfied through farming. Agriculture not only fulfills humans’ basic needs, but also considered as source of employment worldwide. Agriculture is considered as a backbone of economy and source of employment in the developing countries like India. Agriculture contributes 15.4% in the GDP of India. Agriculture activities are broadly categorized into three major areas: pre-harvesting, harvesting and post harvesting. Advancement in area of machine learning has helped improving gains in agriculture. Machine learning is the current technology which is benefiting farmers to minimize the losses in the farming by providing rich recommendations and insights about the crops. This paper presents an extensive survey of latest machine learning application in agriculture to alleviate the problems in the three areas of pre-harvesting, harvesting and post-harvesting. Application of machine learning in agriculture allows more efficient and precise farming with less human manpower with high quality production.},
